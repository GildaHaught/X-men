=Prof X task machine. 

I've created this repo in order to enhance my skills in jQuery, CSS and Rails

functionality: 
1. Create a group.
2. Assign heroes to group. 
3. Delete hero from the group. 
4. Assign task to the group.

to do: 
1. Create a separate div to display tasks and teams in readable manner.
2. Refactor js, css and html. Separate them to the different files. My eyes bleed when I look at this solid piece of crap. 
3. Develop design which would be less scary.
